<h1>About</h1>
<p>Good software is easy to understand, well tested and secure. I am a software 
    developer with 15 years of experience who likes to work with and mentor 
    developers and teams on how they can improve their code quality and security 
    so they can produce better software.</p>
<p>I have experience with various languages including PHP, JavaScript, Rust and 
    TypeScript. If you review my open source contributions you will see I have a 
    great deal of experience with test frameworks, code analysis, documentation 
    and automation. I’ve also written on these topics in detail and given numerous 
    talks to user groups and conferences.</p>

</ul>
<p>Much of the work I have carried out has had a focus on security, and you can 
    see from my open source work I have made contributions to security features 
    such as JSON Web Tokens and Content Security Policies.</p>
<p>During my career I’ve worked with numerous organisations, big and small, 
    including Eurostar, Immediate Media, Breakthrough Media, The Ministry of 
    Justice, the Home Office and many more. I’ve fulfilled roles ranging from 
    senior developer, technical consultant, architect and manager which provides 
    me with an in-depth understanding of the tech industry and the challenges 
    many organisations face.</p>
<p>I believe I have a great deal of experience and insight to offer. So if your 
    organisation cares about open source and good software practices, or needs 
    help to improve in these areas then we should talk further.</p>
<h2>Recent Experience</h2>
<h4>Eurostar, Solution Architect</h4>
<small>July 2019 – Present</small>
<p>Eurostar is a European rail operator and package holiday provider. I work 
    within their online development team as a Solution Architect and I help 
    define technical solutions so Eurostar can deliver their business goals. The 
    role involves technical research, proof of concepts, documentation, 
    stakeholder consultation, and mentoring developers through technical 
    implementation. The projects I have focussed on have been Security and 
    Content related, and have included work on Auth0, Content Security Policies, 
    and Jam Stack technologies such as Sanity and Vercel. The languages involved 
    include JavaScript, TypeScript, and Scala.</p>
<h4>Immediate Media, Senior Developer</h4>
<small>November 2018 - July 2019</small>
<p>Immediate Media operates a number of large UK media brands, such as the Radio 
    Times and BBC Good Food. I worked on their core WordPress and Symfony 
    platform as a senior developer. I helped them build new features and improve 
    existing ones while mentoring and guiding junior developers on topics such 
    as Test Driven Development, code analysis and software architecture and 
    design. Immediate follow an Agile Scrum workflow, most of their systems are 
    based on AWS and they use development tools such as Vagrant and Docker.</p>
<h4>Breakthrough Media, Head of Technology</h4>
<small>May 2016 – August 2018</small>
<p>Breakthrough are a communications agency where I was Head of Technology and 
    ran the software development team. It was made up of front-end and back-end 
    developers, dev-ops, QA and project management, and the team ranged in size 
    from 8-16 during the period I was there. The majority of the work was based 
    around the 40 WordPress websites we managed on behalf of their government 
    and public sector clients. We took a modern approach to building WordPress 
    websites including the use of Composer and Vue.js. We also ran and 
    maintained a number of Laravel based websites for system monitoring and 
    internal administration, and we built a number of Jekyl based websites. 
    My role was both hands on and managerial and it included a lot of strategy, 
    architecture and consultation work. I helped design a number of systems 
    including data warehouses for Breakthrough’s government clients. In addition 
    to this we managed and built data insights tools using Python, JavaScript 
    and Tableau. All Breakthrough’s systems we hosted and maintained on AWS.</p>

<h2>Business History</h2>
<h4>Waller Tech Ltd</h4>
<small>October 2018 – Present</small>
<p>Wllr:Tech is focused on providing organisations with services around code 
    quality and security. The aim is to help organisations improve the software 
    and products they produce so less money is wasted on maintenance issues and 
    more revenue is generated from users. Services provided include training, 
    consultation and implementation help.</p>
<h4>Status People Ltd</h4>
<small>August 2011 – August 2018</small>
<p>StatusPeople was a Social Media Analytics company I founded in 2011. The 
    company was closed in 2018 because I no longer felt I could offer a 
    professional service to our paying clients. StatusPeople developed a number 
    systems, all built around PHP, JavaScript and MySQL. The main tool was a
    Social Analytics platform which allowed marketers to interact with their 
    social media channels and track user interaction. This platform was sold to 
    another company in late 2013.</p>
<p>The most successful product though was The Fakers App which was launched in 
    2012 and did Twitter follow analysis, highlighting how many fake followers 
    an account had. It was very popular, was mentioned in Mashable and on CNN, 
    had 1.5 million users and was still generating incoming when StatusPeople 
    was shut down in 2018. The 
    <a href="https://fakers.statuspeople.com">Fakers App</a> was run as a free 
    service for a further two years and was 
    <a href="https://rbrt.wllr.info/2020/02/28/closing-down-fakers-app.html">
        closed down</a> in early 2020. All the code for the App was open sourced 
        on GitHub so others could make use of some of the ideas 
        contained within.</p> 
    <p>My time running StatusPeople and supporting my own 
    systems taught me a great deal about coding, dev-ops and database management 
    as I had to build and maintain everything myself. It also taught me a lot 
    about the business of technology and the contract law which sits 
    around it.</p>
