<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am an Engineering Leader and Software Developer with nearly 20 years of 
    experience. I am a Director of Product Engineering for TELUS Health and lead 
    a team of 70 frontend, backend and DevOps engineers across Europe and North 
    America. My job is to keep my teams focused on their strategic goals and 
    ensure they continually deliver software that achieves those goals. I do 
    this via good, consistent communication, removing roadblocks, minimising 
    noise, supporting my team's wellbeing and helping them mature.</p>
<p>As a software developer, I have written a lot of PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript 
    and SQL. I've done a lot of DevOps work, building and configuring servers 
    and cloud platforms, I love the command line. In addition, I've worked with 
    C#, Ruby, Python, Java, Rust, Scala, GraphQL and MongoDB, so my software 
    experience is broad. I believe in continual learning and I've learnt new 
    things from every language I have used.</p>
<p>I believe good software is easy to understand, well-tested, secure and 
    performant. This is difficult to achieve as software is complicated and the 
    development process is complex. Teams have to mature towards good software. 
    Methodologies like Agile, Extreme Programming, Continuous Deployment and 
    Test Driven Development can help. Along with observability, you can't fix 
    what you can't see.</p>
<p>Teams must have strategic goals and focus on what they will deliver over the 
    next few sprints to achieve them. Importantly, teams and businesses must be 
    persistent. To solve complex business problems with software teams must 
    persist over a long period, sometimes two or three years. This is the only 
    way to achieve strategic goals. It is also much better for team and 
    individual wellbeing as it reduces pressure. This is critical for long-term 
    performance, talent retention and domain knowledge retention. To achieve 
    great results teams must set a consistent, maintainable pace and persist. 
    Rushing towards deadlines is a recipe for failure.</p>
<p>At TELUS Health I've helped my engineering teams mature and produce better 
    software. We completed a massive migration to Mongo Atlas which improved our 
    security, performance and observability. We also rolled out Datadog APM and 
    RUM across our platform which further enhanced our observability and 
    performance. I have worked at both large and small organisations, so I 
    understand how to work and get things done in both small, nimble 
    environments and large, strategic environments. I've built and sold my own 
    small business and created one of the first social media anti-bot 
    algorithms. I've contributed significantly to Open Source Software which 
    taught me a lot about software best practices such as SOLID, TDD and Static 
    Analysis. I am a strong, confident communicator and have spoken at 
    conferences such as MongoDB.local and PHP UK.</p>
<p>I like to work for organisations that will challenge me as this is the only 
    way to learn and grow. Company culture is important to me. Whether large or 
    small, organisations must be agile in their approach. Organisations obsessed 
    with governance and bureaucracy will not innovate or succeed in the tech 
    space. I believe employee wellbeing is of fundamental importance, burnout 
    must be avoided and flexibility provided. Burnout will lead to the loss of 
    talent and domain knowledge. And you can't build a diverse, well-rounded, 
    successful team without flexibility. Innovative organisations must 
    prioritise these issues because the opportunity and replacement costs are 
    enormous.</p>

<h2>Business History</h2>
<h4>Status People Ltd</h4>
<small>August 2011 – August 2018</small>
<p>StatusPeople was a Social Media Analytics company I founded in 2011. The 
    company was closed in 2018 because I no longer felt I could offer a 
    professional service to our paying clients. StatusPeople developed a number 
    of systems, all built around PHP, JavaScript and MySQL. The main tool was a
    Social Analytics platform which allowed marketers to interact with their 
    social media channels and track user interaction. This platform was sold to 
    another company in late 2013.</p>
<p>The most successful product though was The Fakers App which was launched in 
    2012 and did Twitter follow analysis, highlighting how many fake followers 
    an account had. It was very popular, was mentioned in Mashable and on CNN, 
    had 1.5 million users and was still generating incoming when StatusPeople 
    was shut down in 2018. The 
    <a href="https://fakers.statuspeople.com">Fakers App</a> was run as a free 
    service for a further two years and was 
    <a href="https://rbrt.wllr.info/2020/02/28/closing-down-fakers-app.html">
        closed down</a> in early 2020. All the code for the App was open sourced 
        on GitHub so others could make use of some of the ideas 
        contained within.</p> 
    <p>My time running StatusPeople and supporting my own 
    systems taught me a great deal about coding, dev-ops and database management 
    as I had to build and maintain everything myself. It also taught me a lot 
    about the business of technology and the contract law which sits 
    around it.</p>
