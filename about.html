<h1>About</h1>
<p>Good software is easy to understand, well tested and secure. I am a software 
    developer with 15 years of experience who likes to work with and mentor 
    developers and teams on how they can improve their code quality and security 
    so they can produce better software.</p>
<p>I have experience with various languages including PHP, JavaScript, Rust and 
    TypeScript. If you review my open source contributions you will see I have a 
    great deal of experience with test frameworks, code analysis, documentation 
    and automation. I've also written on these topics in detail and given numerous 
    talks to user groups and conferences.</p>

</ul>
<p>Security is a focus for me, I've done work with platforms like Auth0 and 
    consulted on the topic widely. I've also made open source contributions to 
    security tools focused on JSON Web Tokens and Content Security Policies.</p>
<p>During my career I’ve worked with numerous organisations, big and small, 
    including Eurostar, Immediate Media, Breakthrough Media, The Ministry of 
    Justice, the Home Office and many more. I’ve fulfilled roles ranging from 
    senior developer, technical consultant, architect and manager which provides 
    me with an in-depth understanding of the tech industry and the challenges 
    many organisations face.</p>
<p>I believe I have a great deal of experience and insight to offer. So if your 
    organisation cares about open source and good software practices, or needs 
    help to improve in these areas then we should talk further.</p>

<h2>Business History</h2>
<h4>Status People Ltd</h4>
<small>August 2011 – August 2018</small>
<p>StatusPeople was a Social Media Analytics company I founded in 2011. The 
    company was closed in 2018 because I no longer felt I could offer a 
    professional service to our paying clients. StatusPeople developed a number 
    of systems, all built around PHP, JavaScript and MySQL. The main tool was a
    Social Analytics platform which allowed marketers to interact with their 
    social media channels and track user interaction. This platform was sold to 
    another company in late 2013.</p>
<p>The most successful product though was The Fakers App which was launched in 
    2012 and did Twitter follow analysis, highlighting how many fake followers 
    an account had. It was very popular, was mentioned in Mashable and on CNN, 
    had 1.5 million users and was still generating incoming when StatusPeople 
    was shut down in 2018. The 
    <a href="https://fakers.statuspeople.com">Fakers App</a> was run as a free 
    service for a further two years and was 
    <a href="https://rbrt.wllr.info/2020/02/28/closing-down-fakers-app.html">
        closed down</a> in early 2020. All the code for the App was open sourced 
        on GitHub so others could make use of some of the ideas 
        contained within.</p> 
    <p>My time running StatusPeople and supporting my own 
    systems taught me a great deal about coding, dev-ops and database management 
    as I had to build and maintain everything myself. It also taught me a lot 
    about the business of technology and the contract law which sits 
    around it.</p>
