<h2>The Fakers App</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://fakers.statuspeople.com" target="_blank">Fakers App</a>,
    was launched in 2012 and was a very successful product. The premise of the 
    app was to do follower analysis on Twitter and highlight how many followers
    were either fake or inactive. This was a significant issue at the time 
    because many people were buying fake followers for their Twitter
    accounts. This meant fellow users and organisations couldn't be sure how 
    popular a Twitter account really was.</p>
<p>The app was used by over 1.5 million people, and it's blocking tool which 
    helped users remove fake followers from their accounts blocked 10s of 
    millions of fake accounts. The Fakers App was also mentioned in the media 
    across the world including 
    <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/22/twitter-facebook-fake-followers/" target="_blank">Mashable</a> 
    and in an interview on 
    <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/video/?hpt=hp_c2#/video/tech/2012/08/27/unmasking-fake-twitter-accounts.cnn" target="_blank">CNN</a>.</p>
<p>The App was 
    <a href="https://rbrt.wllr.info/2020/02/28/closing-down-fakers-app.html">closed down</a> 
    in early 2020 as it was felt the app's time had passed and it was becoming 
    increasingly difficult to maintain. All of the code from the app was open 
    sourced on <a href="https://github.com/RobDWaller/StatusPeopleSpam">GitHub</a> 
    so other developers might be able to repurpose some of the ideas 
    contained within.</p>
    <p>There was also nice feedback from users of the app once it was closed 
        down, this was touching and highlighted its value to people 
        and organisations.</p>
