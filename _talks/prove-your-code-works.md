## Talk Abstract

The tech industry has a problem with quality and security. A lot of software produced is subpar and often dangerous. The reason for this is because professional standards are not widely adopted. The aim of professional software development is to provide guarantees and prove code works. This talk will delve into professionalism and how good documentation, tests and code analysis can help tech teams become more professional.

## Talk Description

The tech industry has a problem with software quality and security. There are [many](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/08/ico_threatens_ba_with_huge_fine_for_huge_data_loss/), [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos) examples of where things have gone wrong and users have been harmed. There is also [lots](https://twitter.com/Ocramius/status/1249963501340233730) and [lots](https://twitter.com/afilina/status/1239623168681271296) of anecdotal evidence organisations don't take the issues of quality and security seriously. One of the contributing factors is the lack of professional standards within the industry and an unwillingness among many organisations to implement any. 

Professionalism is something developers and everyone involved in technology should care about deeply. As the social and financial consequences when software development goes wrong can be enormous. 

This talk will delve into the subject of professionalism and what it means for the tech industry. It will answer a number of questions to help understand the topic and define what professional standards look like for software developers and the tech industry.  

**What is professionalism?** it provides a guarantee work carried out will be of a reasonable standard. It is not the same as 'good' or 'great' and should not be confused with these terms. There is a difference between a well built house and a beautiful mansion which sits atop the Hollywood Hills.

**What do professional standards look like in other industries?** Many other industries like medicine, accountancy and construction follow professional standards, much of which is backed by law and regulation. You cannot just build a house like you can build a website or app.

**What professional standards can software developers and the tech industry follow?** As an industry, and as a base guarantee, we should be able to prove the code we produce works. This means we should be able to provide observability of our work so we can highlight information which proves we've made every effort to ensure things work properly. There are three areas which software developers and tech teams should focus on: Documentation, Tests and Code Analysis. 

**What are the benefits of professional standards to the tech industry?** the main benefit is fewer bugs. This may seem like a trivial benefit, but it does have enormous consequences. It will improve the user experience and reduce the need for maintenance. Both of these will have financial consequences, the former will help generate more revenue and the latter will reduce costs. There are also many other benefits.

## Notes

Professionalism is a topic I care about deeply and have spent the past few years discussing and writing about issues around this topic.
