## Elevator Pitch
> You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

Management is a difficult area for many developers to move into as it is very different to programming. Based on my learnings as a tech lead, running a business and teachings from sport and history I wish to share my tips for those who want to become managers and succeed at running tech teams.

## Description
> You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

Taking the step from coding to management is a difficult one that is not right for every developer. My talk aims to guide those considering management through some of the pitfalls and challenges they may face. In addition, I want to encourage developers of all skill levels to consider management because programming capability is not the most important attribute of a good manager.  

The talk is broken down into five topics detailed below and each aims to solve some of the mystery surrounding management for those who haven't experienced it before. Two of the most important topics are the qualities of a good manager and how to lead, or more specifically how to guide and mentor. These sections will focus on many of the non-code related skills and attributes a good tech manager requires.

The talk will draw on my own learnings along with those from history and sports. It will consider what thinkers like Socrates and Machiavelli had to say on the topic. Along with answering important questions like why Sir Alex Ferguson was an average footballer but a great manager.   

### The Qualities of a Good Tech Manager
There are many qualities a good manager has, two of the most important are balance and compromise. A good tech manager has to learn how to get a team of developers with very different outlooks, opinions and approaches to work together. Often they will have to compromise on quality due to budget restraints or tight deadlines, and they'll have to cope with the frustrations this may cause. Managers must learn to work and communicate with other departments, teams and people with no technical knowledge, often to defend and protect their team. And importantly they need to know the difference between good, ok and bad, and learn to accept that ok is all that is achievable sometimes.

### Hiring People
Hiring within a tech team isn't just about hiring developers, it's also one of the most challenging aspects of management. A bad hire can disrupt a team, upset people and destroy a project. Managers must learn to hire those who are more skilled than them without fear. Their primary aim must be to acquire the skills for their team so it grows and improves. They must help hire the QAs and the Project Managers to ensure they work well with their team. They therefore must learn about different skillsets, particularly the softer social skills. This requires research, hard work and a robust interview process; one that includes tests, or validation as it should be known.

### How to Lead and Bring People With You
Setting a direction for your team or handing out orders isn't enough, developers won't write more unit tests just because you tell them to, you must give them a reason to. A good manager understands that there is often a chasm between where a team is today and where they need to be. You can't ask anyone to jump across a chasm, just as much as you can't ask a team of developers who've not heard of PSR to begin writing unit tests. As a manager you must help your team build a bridge across the various chasms they need to cross. You'll need to focus on incremental improvement and encourage self learning so your team grows organically. Most importantly you must learn to push your team forward and lead by example, never ever drag it.

### Communication: Internal and External
Improving communication within a team helps everyone. People know what each other are doing, they know when someone might need help, they can talk through problems as a team. Encourage daily stand ups, friendly and well defined code reviews, retrospectives on big projects and make sure everyone is involved. Always communicate to your team with clarity and honesty, if you're not happy about something tell them, but always explain why and be open to feedback. Tech managers also have to communicate with non-technical people and teams. Always try to remain calm, try to guide people to sensible answers and focus on explaining complexity. Be prepared to write lots of Power Points, draw things out and whiteboard complicated ideas.       

### Dealing With the Unexpected
Tech management isn't just about technology and writing code. You'll have to deal with lots of other issues, the mental wellbeing of team members' and their complicated personal lives. You'll have to work closely with HR. You'll have to be prepared to deal with individuals' stupid mistakes, their failed attempts at beginning office romances... Occasionally you'll have to fire people, learn to act quickly and decisively, don't dither, you'll only regret it. Always be prepared to deal with the unexpected and always aim to maintain stability so your team can focus on the work and challenges they need to deal with.

## Notes
> This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

This talk has no technical requirements, even people from non-technical backgrounds may find it useful. It is primarily aimed at mid to senior level developers who are considering their career path and thinking that management may be an option.

I have spent the last 13 years working in the software industry, I've written lots of different code including JavaScript, VB, C#, Bash, SQL and Python. I have spent the majority of my career though writing PHP, I'm a massive fan of the community and attend many community events.

Currently I am the Head of Technology at a Communications Agency in London called Breakthrough Media where I run the tech team. We are a group of PHP and JavaScript developers along with QAs and Digital Project Managers. We code a lot of WordPress and Laravel, but we also do a lot of Vue and bits and pieces of Python.

I was hired by Breakthrough two years ago to help improve their technology team, better define their working processes and improve the robustness and security of their infrastructure. In this time we've moved from a team of contract developers to a team that is now 90% permanent and we're no longer using PHPMyAdmin. We've had some successes and some failures, it's been a fun and interesting period that has taught me a great deal.

Before Breakthrough I was a contractor and ran my own business. I had some success, I built an app that got my business mentioned in Mashable and on CNN, I then sold my business, and finally I nearly went bankrupt. It was a crazy, fun and depressing period. I learnt a lot though, for example, make sure you read and understand every line of a contract before you sign it. I'd advise everyone to try and run a business at some stage in their life.

Overall I believe I have a great deal of insight and guidance to offer developers and aspiring technical managers. Not just based on my current role but also my previous business experience. I would love the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with a wider audience.

You can find out more about me via the following resources, you'll note I also have a degree in History which I hope shows I'm a well rounded individual.
