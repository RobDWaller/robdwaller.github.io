Not enough good developers move into management and this has a negative impact on our industry as it can lead to bad business decisions made by ill-informed individuals. This talk offers five tips to guide and encourage developers to consider a management role as this will improve our industry and the lives of developers generally.

## Description
> You should make the description of your talk as compelling and exciting as possible. Remember, you're selling both the organizers of the events to select your talk, as well as trying to convince attendees your talk is the one they should see.

Management is not a topic of interest for many developers as it diverges from their main interest which is code. It is though a very important topic for developers as management decisions can have serious effects on their jobs and their work. Often technical management decisions are made be ill-informed people who do not have enough technical experience nor understand how business decisions can effect software development and output. It is there fore important that good developers go on to become good technical managers.

Transitioning from code to management can be both a challenging and daunting process. This talk offers five tips that will encourage and guide developers through some of the basic problems and issues that developers will face as they learn to become good managers.

### You Don't Have to be a Great Coder to be a Great Manager

What often puts developers off becoming managers or tech leads is the assumption that you have to be a great coder, or the best in your team. This is a damaging misconception as managers need many other skills along with their ability to code. Developers should not focus too much on their ability to code when considering a move into management but focus on other important factors such as experience and communication skills. They should take inspiration from other fields, such as sport, where often the best managers are not the most technically gifted, but those who can communicate well, show leadership and have a wide appreciation of their subject and its place in a wider organisation.

### Mistakes Will Happen

Every manager will make mistakes, especially new ones, as navigating through the array of challenges management involves is difficult. What is important though is not the mistake itself but how the manager responds to the mistake. Good managers need to take ownership of their mistakes and learn to apologise where is appropriate. Most importantly though they need to learn how to change and improve after a mistake. And finally they need to learn to keep moving and put their mistakes behind them.

### Expect the Unexpected

Tech management isn't just about technology and writing code, managers have to deal with lots of other issues. Eg the mental wellbeing of their team, their complicated personal lives and many other issues. Managers have to learn to work with departments such as HR and always be prepared to deal with the unexpected. Anything can happen, but a manager's main aim should be to maintain team stability while odd or difficult situations are occurring. This is so that their team can focus on delivering the work they have been assigned

### Learn to Compromise

As developers we often have quite high standards, as managers though there are times when compromises will need to be made which may lower our standards. This can be for many reasons, business priorities, financial restrictions, difficult clients. It is important to understand how to compromise and what to compromise on. Good managers find a balance between being belligerent and a pushover, the former will damage your inter-team relationships and the latter your team itself. Managers should draw up a short list of 'lines in the sand' that they're not willing to compromise on. These lines must be understandable to the non-technical because they will require the buy in of other teams and managers. In all other areas managers should be willing to compromise.

### Keep Coding

Developers often think when they become managers they must stop coding, but this is of course nonsense. It is very important that tech managers keep on coding. It is important that managers continue to code as their learning does not stop when they becomem managers. Also they will gain respect from their team members and they will keep up to date with the latest technical innovations. It can of course be difficult for managers to find the time to code, especially during the working day. Managers though should not worry too much about this and recognise that a couple of hours a week working on a personal a project is more than enough to keep them in touch.   

## Notes
> This is where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

This talk has no technical requirements, even people from non-technical backgrounds may find it useful. It is primarily aimed at all developers who are considering their career path and thinking that management may be an option for them now or in the future.

I have been a technical manager for two years, running a team of ten developers, QAs and project managers. In addition, I spent a few years running a startup which I eventually sold to a larger company. These experiences have provided me with a great insight into management and the business of technology more widely which I'd love to share with other developers.
