## Talk Abstract

There are two types of tests a developer can write, ‘test to work’ and ‘test to break’. Both are essential to robust development, but many developers only use the former and not the latter. This talk explains why ‘test to break’ principles are essential to ensure robust application development.

## Talk Description

This talk focuses on what good management, planning and process look like and explains why they are essential to successful tech projects.

- **Management:** this sits at the heart of project failure, bad management always leads to project failure. Good managers hire the right developers, support their staff, and set realistic goals and deadlines.
- **Planning:** developers need clear requirements to deliver what is desired. Good planning helps define understandable tasks, clarify complexity, highlight unknowns and define priority. All of which are essential to project success.
- **Process:** helps ensure quality by catching bugs and ensuring business requirements are delivered. Process is not about code, but about communication, code reviews, testing and deployment steps. All of which ensure the end product is as good as it can be.
