these arguments are good for people and the creation of ideas 

i dont know

accepting you may be wrong is the route of liberalism

because you may be wrong you accept that imposing large catch all solutions probably isn't sensible

markets are an imperfect solution to incredibly complicated problem

people misjudge complexity all the time.

the state should be small because humans are deeply falible

information isnt perfect

people dont like change

very few people are good at dealing with change, very few people are dynamic 

good ideas imposed too quickly can have adverse effects

the EU is not necessarily a bad idea but it has expanded its scope to quickly.

tools like the internet are different

history tell us this most big change takes generations

its not because people are evil, they are used to the way things work 

the chasm problem

i like development because it is built around being wrong

most development arguments / problems are based around the issue of being wrong

you must become comfortable with not knowing.

markets are good at breaking down very complex problems into smaller more easily solved problems.

how do i easily book a hotel room?

some things are far more complicated than they seem, for example making a cup of tea.
