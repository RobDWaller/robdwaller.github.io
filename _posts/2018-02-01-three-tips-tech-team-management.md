I've been a manager of a tech team for two years now and earlier in my career I ran a start up for a couple of years. As such I've had an interest in magement for quite a while. 

However management doesn't seem to be something that often gets discussed among developers. We're generally much more interested in the pros and cons of various frameworks or design patterns.

Management though is a very important topic and there are a number of things I wish I'd known before I started running a team of developers, QAs and Project Managers.

The following are a few tips that I've picked up, learnt or read about over the last two years.

### Great Developers Don't Make Great Managers

This is of course a lie, great developers can make great managers. The point is though that if you're considering a management role rememeber you don't have to be a great developer to be a great manager. 

It is important that you have experience and a good understanding of code and technical issues, but you don't have to be the best in your team at it. Management is about a lot more than your field of expertise so don't let your code capability put you off a management role. 

A good analogy for this point is Football, what do the following football managers all have in common?

- Alex Fergusson
- Arsene Wenger
- Pep Guardiola
- Jurgen Klopp
- Jose Mourinho

Answer: none of them were particularly good at football. They are though some of the most decorated managers in the game. The theory goes that average football players make better managers because the emphasise better with average players and can therefore get more out of them. Great players by contrast often can't comprehend why less capable players can't do what they can.

There is of course exceptions to every rule and Johan Cruyff is one of those. Cruyff was not only one the greatest footballers of all time, big also one of the greatest managers too. He is widely regarded as the most influential footballer of all time.

Even Cruyff admits though that management is about far more than technical skill. That it is impprtant to understand what you are good at 

### Mistakes Will Happen

This is simple, you will make mistakes. If it's your first management role you won't necessarilly know how to respond to every situation. You will make mistakes, it's ok, note them down for next time and move on.

### Learn to Compromise

### Expect the Unexpected

No one can write a precise guide to management. Simply expect and be prepared for the unexpected. 

You might be running a tech team and you may have a lot of experience dealng with technical problems. When you become a manager though you're going to have to deal with a whole array of issues that outside your technical expertise.

You will be exposed to people's personal issues; looking after their mental health; team members clumsy attempts at office rommances; inter-team arguments; a whole array of issues.

Expect this and be prepared to deal with these issues in as measured and sensitive manner as possible.
