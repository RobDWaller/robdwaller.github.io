Over the last few months I've been doing a great deal of work on Tableau integrations. For those of you who don't know what Tableau is, it is a very powerful data visualisation tool.

It has many built in data connectors for databases like MySQL, MS-SQL and other data stores. However it has very few API integrations for social networks and other useful data sources.

Tableau though offers a JavaScript SDK on which you can build you own Web Data Connectors to various online data sources. Over thelast few months I have been working on a comprehensive WDC integration between Tableau and Facebook. 

From this work comes Fableau which is a much smaller, less capable Tableau Web Data Connetor for Facebook. However Fableau achieves a few things, first it does pull page and post metric data back from Facebook, it also provides a building block on which to develop bigger Web Data Connectors, not just for Facebook but other data sources. Finaly I hope people will feedback.
