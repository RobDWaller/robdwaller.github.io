"The ultimate goal is to build general purpose smart machines -- that's many decades away. But this is going from pixels to actions, and it can work on a challenging task even humans find difficult. It's a baby step, but an important one."

Atari Games initially had to create individual neural networks to complete each game.
They are working on sequential learning. Remember what it had learnt from previous games.
But results are not as good as task specific neural networks

"To have AIs think the way you and I do, they need to move towards models that can reuse concepts, understand cause and effect," says D. Scott Phoenix, a co-founder of Vicarious.

The AI reads three frames in a row. If the pixels in those three frames depict a ball hitting some bricks, the deep reinforcement learning network uses the points it scores in the game as a feedback mechanism, and rates that series of frames favorably. The AI, of course, can move the paddle left, right, and it can also release the ball. But it doesn't know it can do this. All it knows is that it can issue these three commands, and sometimes one of these commands will correlate with a favorable sequence of frames. Over time, it gets good at the game. To humans, it looks like technology is learning to move the paddle back and forth, release the ball, bounce the ball, earn points. It's better than brute force, but it's still nowhere near critical reasoning.

Vicarious' Schema Networks, on the other hand, think more like humans do—at least according to Phoenix. "It starts much like a child would, doing something and seeing what happens," he says. It learns objects—paddle, ball, brick—and it learns how those objects move and interact with one another. Schema Networks, says Phoenix, calculates probabilities for how the ball will fly off the paddle each time they collide. Based on these probabilities, it moves its paddle to the optimum place. It's not just breaking bricks, it's aiming to clear the level in the most efficient way possible.

But those arenas aren't the AI thunderdome. Oren Etzioni, the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, says video games are pretty limited for testing AI with the ambition to power robots. "You observe the entire scene in Atari games. Does the method work in cases that you have partial observation? The answer is highly likely No,"
