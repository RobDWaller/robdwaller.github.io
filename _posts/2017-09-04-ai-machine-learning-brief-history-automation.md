It is impossible to have a complete discussion on the impact of AI and Machine Learning without first considering History. In the series introduction two points were stated, first that AI and Machine Learning are currently focussed on improving automation. Secondly this automation will revolutionise our lives, our work and economy. 

History is a very useful tool for assessing what the future holds as very little is new when it comes to human affairs. For example the Romans had Piblic Private Partnerships / Initiatives. Western governments hadn't stumbled on some new innovation when they began to introduce them after the 1980s, and maybe they should have considered the Roman example before they did.

Like most things automation is not a new phenomena. The roots of automation begin in 18th century Britain and then expanded out across Europe and America. During the 1700s a great number of inventions and discoveries began to increase human power and efficiency, and enable automation. 

In 1712 Thomas Newcomen developed the first commercial Steam Engine; by the end of the century inventors had begun to experiment with Internal Combustion Engines; By 1821 Michael Faraday had developed the first electromagnetic rotorary motor
