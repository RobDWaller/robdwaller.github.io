It is impossible to have a complete discussion on the impact of AI and Machine Learning without first considering History. In the series introduction two points were raised about AI and Machine Learning. First that its current focus is advanced automation, and second that this automation will revolutionise our lives, our work and economy.

History is a very useful tool for assessing what the future holds. Little is truly new in the human experience and the past offers examples of how humans responded to similar problems to the ones we face today. Automation is no different, it is not a new phenomena and has a long and interesting history.

The roots of automation truly took hold in 18th century Britain and then expanded across Europe and America. During the 1700s a great number of inventions and discoveries began to increase human power and efficiency, and enable automation.

In 1712 Thomas Newcomen developed the first commercial steam engine; by the end of the century inventors had begun to experiment with internal combustion engines; In 1821 Michael Faraday unveiled the first electromagnetic rotary motor; Fast forward a century and in 1943 Tommy Flowers had built the first digital, programmable computer; In 1969 the first message was sent across ARPANET; and by 1993 thanks to the work of Tim Berners Lee we had HTML and the birth of the Internet as we know it today.

Across a period of roughly 300 years automation flourished, driven by invention. Of course the people referenced are merely a selection of those involved in the great automation revolution. Also many of the inventions highlighted were not truly original discoveries, the steam engine for example possibly goes back as far as the 1st century AD, and humans have played with computing tools as far back as the second century BC. However during the 1700s there was a confluence on invention that was put to commercial and industrial use, in a way not previously experienced.

This is where we move on to two people not already mentioned but of great importance to the story of automation. They weren't inventors as such or maybe not true engineers or scientists like the others mentioned, they were though two of the great entrepreneurs and industrialists who helped drive automation forward. They are Richard Arkwright the father of the factory system and Henry Ford the father of the assembly line.

Richard Arkwright was born in 1732 in Lancashire England and made his name and fortune in the cotton industry. In fact it would be fair to say he created the cotton industry. In 1769 Arkwright with the help of John Kay developed the spinning frame, which later became the water frame. The spinning frame automated the process of turning raw cotton into thread, which greatly reduced its production cost. Arkwright also worked on improving machines that turned cotton buds to cotton fibres, or carding machines. 

In 1771 he set up his first water powered factory in Cromford Derbyshire. As a result Arkwright was probably the first person to mechanise and automate the process of turning a raw material into a product, with little human human skill required.  

Arkwright grew an empire, by the time he died in 1792 up to 30,000 people were employed in Factories using his patents and he left a fortune of Â£500,000.
