It is impossible to have a complete discussion on the impact of AI and Machine Learning without first considering History. In the series introduction two points were raised about AI and Machine Learning. First that its current focus is advanced automation, and Second that this automation will revolutionise our lives, our work and economy. 

History is a very useful tool for assessing what the future holds. Little is truly new in the human experience and the past offers examples of how humans responded to similar problems we face today. Automation no different, it is not a new phenomena and has a long and interesting history. 

The roots of automation truly took hold in 18th century Britain and then expanded across Europe and America. During the 1700s a great number of inventions and discoveries began to increase human power and efficiency, and enable automation. 

In 1712 Thomas Newcomen developed the first commercial steam engine; by the end of the century inventors had begun to experiment with internal combustion engines; In 1821 Michael Faraday unveiled the first electromagnetic rotorary motor; Fast foward a century and in 1943 Tommy Flowers had built the first digital, programmable computer; In 1969 the first message was sent across ARPANET; and by 1993 thanks to the work of Tim Berners Lee we had HTML and the birth of the Internet as we know it today. 

Across a period of roughly 300 years automation flourished, driven by invention. Of course the people referenced are merely a selection of those involved in the great automation reveloution. Also many of the in

However two people not mentioned and of great importance to this story are Richard Arkwright and Henry Ford.
