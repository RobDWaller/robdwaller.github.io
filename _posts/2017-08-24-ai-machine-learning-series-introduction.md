Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are two industry buzz words that we're hearing more and more of at the moment. Even at my work there are faint rumblings of interest in the topics. This of course has both grabbed my attention and poked my 'sceptics bone'...

As a result I've begun researching and learning about the subjects and I have also agreed to give two talks on them. To help this process along, and share my thoughts and research more widely I'm going to write a series of blog posts.

As an introduction I'm going to state my starting position and what I'll cover during these posts. Maybe as these posts progress my initial view will change, we'll have to see.

Overall I'm an optimistic cynic, while I believe machine learning may revolutionise the way we live and work I don't believe a 'Skynet' AI revolution will occur any time soon, if at all. As AI expert [@PaulScharre](https://twitter.com/PaulScharre) recently said in a [Channel 4 interview](https://www.channel4.com/news/paul-scharre-terminator-scenario-is-far-fetched) about 'Killer Robots'...

>I think a Terminator scenario like we see in science fiction movies, that's pretty far fetched, that's a long ways off and I think we can sleep safely at night not worrying about those kind of scenarios. But the basic technology to put together a weapon that could go out on its own, that could find its own targets that exists today.

Paul Scharre raises an important point, that there is a significant difference between Machine Learning and Sentient AI. Machine learning is merely scratching the surface of AI and there are a huge array of issues to overcome before we achieve what is really meant by AI. We may also find we don't need or want to bother with it. One of the primary topics to overcome is conciousness, something we don't know a great deal about.

The media are also having great fun with the topic. The recent Facebook AI Bot shutdown was described [in the Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/techandgadgets/london-tech-expert-dont-expect-skynet-situation-any-time-soon-after-facebook-shuts-down-ai-a3601601.html) thusly...

> A London-based artificial inteligence expert has played down fears of a runaway AI "consuming everything in its path" in scenes similar to Terminator 2 after Facebook shut down two chat robots that developed their own language.

The idea we're near 'Skynet' is more click bait than truth. In this case Facebook simply turned off an experiment that didn't work out. Overall the likelihood of humanity achieving the AI 'singularity' in the next 50 years is low.

Despite my skeptical outlook on AI I am very excited by the prospect of Machine Learning. It has the potential to revolutionise our economy and they way we live our lives for the better.


conciousness, history, economic effects.
