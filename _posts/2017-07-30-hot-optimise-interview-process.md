A related piece of advice is don't hem yourself in with the junior, mid, senior categories. If you're searching for a senior, but find a great, cheaper mid, go for the mid. It's better to have a great mid than an average senior. To define an average senior, they can code really well, but they lack other skills such as communication and mentoring. Remember it's easier to teach someone code than the softer skills they may lack.
