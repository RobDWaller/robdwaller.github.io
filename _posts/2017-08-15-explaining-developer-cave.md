A couple of weeks ago I did a presentation to the agency on a website my team
built. As part of this presentation I decided to explain what the basic development
roles are and I came up with the 'development cave'...

Really this is just a little bit of fun, but it aims to show the unseen nature of many development roles. While a front end dev's work is exposed to the sunlight, dev-ops is lost in the darkness of the cave...

It also highlights how developers often wander from front end to dev-ops over the course of their career. 

At some point you turn around, you can't see the light anymore and you're stuck doing dev-ops for people... At least that's what has happened to me...
