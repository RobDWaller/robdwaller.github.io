There are a couple of things we understand about skill, it's a finite resource and it's not evenly distributed. If you are a fan of professional sports you know these things to be true, and like myself if you are a fan of Football (Soccer) you know there is only one Lionel Messi and he is monstrously skilled*.

In any skill based profession such as Football skill is distributed like a rhombus**. At the very top there are those who are good, and they probably make up about 1% of the players, the great players like Lionel Messi are the 1% of the 1%, they're very rare. The next tranche probably represents 20% to 30% and can defined as decent, most Premier League footballers are decent. Around the middle of the rhombus, about 70% of players, can be defined as competent and represent the rest of the professional players, in England we have four professional football leagues. At the very bottom, say 1% there are those who are bad, as in they probably shouldn't be doing what they are doing, again they are rare.

Some may argue that skill is better represented by a pyramid, as the base gets progressively bigger as you move from highly skilled to no skill. As in the vast majority of the population have no skill at football. This though is misleading as it does not allow us to properly assess professional skill. For example any professional footballer looks highly skilled compared to me as I'm terrible at football. The reality is in most skilled professions there are very few good people and very few bad people. The majority of professionals sit somewhere between the poles.

So what does this have to do with software development? Well, everything.

- The skill Rhombus
- Successful Managers
- Don't focus just on technical Skill
- Apply the right working methodologies to your skill

* It should be noted I really dislike Lionel Messi, but I can't deny reality.
* A bell curve maybe a more technical definition.
