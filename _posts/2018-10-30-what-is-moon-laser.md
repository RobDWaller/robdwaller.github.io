A Moon laser is a tech project a developer should either walk away from or encourage their client to seriously re-think.

Moon laser projects have three traits:

- Difficult
- Expensive
- Stupid

Placing a laser on the Moon complies with all three of these traits. The Moon is about 400,000 km from the Earth and it can only be reached by leaving the Earth's atmosphere and traveling through the vacuum of space. So it is difficult to get to. The only way to get their currently is via a spaceship AKA rocket. Rockets are very expensive, the last rocket to land something on the moon cost $70m. And that is only the launch cost, the total cost would have been hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe billions.

Finally you'd have to question why you'd want to stick a laser on the moon? What's its purpose? There is no purpose as there aren't any good reasons. Even if you're Dr Evil there are no lasers powerful enough to blow up cities so you can't hold the world to ransom to cover your costs. Sticking a laser on the Moon has no reasonable or useful purpose so it is a stupid idea.

Many developers will have been asked to work on a Moon laser project during their careers. When you are asked to work on a Moon laser, you have three options:

- Work on the project and fail to deliver
- Walk away
- Encourage the client to re-think their proposal

Often though you won't have the choice to walk away from the project. It's your job, you have kids to feed, a mortgage to pay, etc, etc. Option one is also not really viable as you will fail, you may be blamed, you may not get paid, you may loose your job.

So the only sensible option you have is to learn how to handle Moon lasers and encourage your client, manager or company to re-think their proposal. Obviously this process does not begin by saying:

> "Are you a ******* moron?!! What are you thinking?!! That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard!!"

While this may be quite true, it's not necessarily feedback that will be well received. Instead you need to guide your client to a more sensible path.

For instance, all developers have met or worked for someone who's said:

>"I've got an idea, I want to build the new [~Insert Facebook AirBnB TripAdvisor Uber Google Amazon Etc~]".

Anyone who says this has a Moon laser on their hands. To build an equivalent platform to any of these companies would be prohibitively expensive and difficult. These companies are years ahead and have hundreds / thousands of developers at hand. Also the business plan is stupid, why would any user leave one of those platforms and use yours? Answer is they wouldn't or it is highly unlikely.

This does not mean though your company or client can't move into one of the business sectors the companies above dominate. The way to do this is to focus on a simple, unique service, that creates customer value, and can be proto-typed by to two to three developers within three to six months.

Launch Quicker
Cheaper
Keep costs down
Easier to throw away
Fail faster

We know this approach works.
