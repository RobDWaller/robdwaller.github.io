title: 'Developers and the Genius Syndrome Problem'

The majority of developers that I've met during my career have been clever people. Many of them I'd even describe as geniuses, that is they are significantly more intelligent and capable than the average. Very few of them I'd describe as idiots. I can probably count on one hand the number of developers I'd describe as idiots or suggest to them they look for an alternate career.

This of course is great for those who work in development, you get to spend your day surrounded by and engaging with intelligent people. You'll learn lots and work on interesting challenges with great people.

There is though a danger with this situation which is often overlooked. This danger I'd describe as 'Genius Syndrome'. This is the situation where a very clever person or people begin to believe their own hype and believe they cannot fail. This of course leads to all sorts of catastrophic failures.

Marco Pivetta touches on this concept in his excellent talk on defensive programming. He takes a slightly different tack to myself describing people as idiots, it aims at the same end as myself. But I'd describe this concept as throwaway and not getting to the heart of the problem.

its simple, it implies i understand
