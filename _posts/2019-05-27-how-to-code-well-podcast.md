Peter's [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/user/howtocodewell) is a really great listen generally, with some great interviews so check it out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/howtocodewell) and give him a follow on Twitter [@pfwd](https://twitter.com/pfwd) and [@HowToCodeWell](https://twitter.com/HowToCodeWell).
