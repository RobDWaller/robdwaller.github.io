I've been working on a new website project and I've needed to give it a simple and reasonable design to get started. This is quite difficult as I have zero design skills.

There are though some great, free design tools online which are very helpful and I thought I'd make a quick note of a few of them. They may help other design incapable, back-end developers like myself.

**Google Fonts:** Obvious but very useful, if you need a free font to spice up your design a little use this tool.

**SVG Repo:** If you need some nice icons for your site then there are some lovely free ones available on this site.

**Coolors:** Need a colour scheme for your site then the Coolors colour scheme generator tool is really helpful.

**Vecta Nano:** You'll probably want to compress any SVG icons you find online. If you only have a few of them then Vecta Nano is a very easy tool to use.
